Description: Preprocess and analysis of genomic data. 'MPAgenomics'
    provides wrappers from commonly used packages to streamline their repeated
    manipulation, offering an easy-to-use pipeline. The segmentation of
    successive multiple profiles is performed with an automatic choice of
    parameters involved in the wrapped packages. Considering multiple profiles
    in the same time, 'MPAgenomics' wraps efficient penalized regression methods
    to select relevant markers associated with a given outcome.
